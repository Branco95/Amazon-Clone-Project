# Amazon Clone Project

This is a simple Amazon clone built full created with JavaScript. The application connects to a database to retrieve products and offers various features.

## Features

- **Product Management**: Users can browse products and easily add them to their shopping cart.
- **Cart Functionality**: At checkout, users can update the quantity of each product and remove items from their cart.
- **Delivery Options**: The delivery date is calculated automatically, with options for free shipping and two additional shipping methods.
- **Automatic Cost Calculation**: The total cost is dynamically calculated based on the chosen shipping option and delivery fees.
- **Order Placement**: Users can place an order, which redirects them to a dedicated tracking order page (under "construction").

## Future Implementations

- **Product Search**: Giving the search bar "life", to allow users to quickly find products given their names.
- **Interactive Tracking Page**: The tracking page is still full static.
